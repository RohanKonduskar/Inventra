The system is modular and role-based, allowing authorized users to interact with various features including Dashboard, Products, Summary, and Re-Stock modules. Inventra’s primary objective is to provide a scalable, easy-to-use solution that enhances operational transparency, reduces manual workload, and supports data-driven decision-making. By digitizing critical inventory processes and integrating real-time data updates, Inventra empowers businesses to maintain optimal stock levels, avoid losses due to overstocking or, and improve overall operational efficiency.
